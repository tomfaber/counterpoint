counterpoint
============

Counterpoint helper, for music theory students
(a.k.a. helping my wife do her homework)

In the initial stage, this will be a command line tool that lets you enter a cantus firmus, then enter
a line of melody, which will be matched up to the cantus firmus and validated based on the rules of
first, second, or third species counterpoint.

If I have time, it will also generate valid lines based on a given cantus firmus.   And in the long
run, I'd really like a nice looking and usable GUI for it.
